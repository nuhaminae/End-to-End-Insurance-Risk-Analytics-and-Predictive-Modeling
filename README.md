## Overview

The insurance industry relies heavily on data-driven risk assessment to make informed decisions regarding policy pricing, claims management, and customer segmentation. This repository demonstrates a full pipeline, from data ingestion and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It will also include feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and interpretation at completion.

The project leverages Jupyter Notebooks for transparency and reproducibility, with Python as the core programming language.

## Features

- End-to-end workflow covering:
  - Data cleaning and pre-processing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Visualisation of insights
- Modular and well-documented code for easy adaptation to similar datasets or business problems
- Example notebooks for each stage of the analytics process

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nuhaminae/End-to-End-Insurance-Risk-Analytics-and-Predictive-Modeling.git
   cd End-to-End-Insurance-Risk-Analytics-and-Predictive-Modeling
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

- Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory sequentially to follow the workflow.
- Replace sample data with your own dataset if required.
- Adjust configuration and parameters in the notebooks as needed for your specific use case.

---

## Data

This project assumes access to a structured insurance dataset, containing features such as:
- Policyholder demographics (age, gender, location)
- Policy details (type, value, duration)
- Claims history and outcomes
- Additional external or derived variables

> **Disclaimer:** No sensitive or proprietary data is included in this repository. Example datasets may be used for demonstration purposes only.

---

## Modelling Approach

- **Pre-processing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, standardisation/scaling.
- **EDA:** Univariate and multivariate analysis, visualisation of distributions, outlier detection.

---

## Results & Visualisations

All major findings, performance metrics, and plots are presented within the relevant notebooks. These include:
- Some summary statistics and data visualisation charts are saved in `plot imgaes/` folder
